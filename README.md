# 🌟 JavaScript ES6 Projects Collection

Welcome to my curated collection of mini-projects built with modern JavaScript (ES6).  
This repository is designed to help beginners and aspiring frontend developers **learn by building** real-world applications using the latest JavaScript features.

---

## 📌 Overview

JavaScript is one of the most essential languages in web development, and ES6 introduced powerful new features that make coding more efficient and cleaner.  
This repository includes a variety of small-scale projects that demonstrate practical uses of:

- `let`, `const` and block scoping
- Arrow functions (`=>`)
- Template literals and string interpolation
- Array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Destructuring and spread/rest operators
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- LocalStorage
- Fetch API & async JavaScript
- Firebase integration in some apps

Each project is created with simplicity in mind, yet offers room for growth, customization, and learning.
